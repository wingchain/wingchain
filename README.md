Wingchain is an open source, easy to start and ready to scale block chain.

# Motivation

Wingchain is committed to becoming the first choice for `trustless` storage 
products, and obtaining the achievements MySQL and Redis have got in their 
respective area.

<table>
<tr>
    <td>Redis</td>

# Positioning

Wingchain is not
 - framework (like Substrate, Tendermint)
 - platform (like Polkadot, Cosmos)

Wingchain is an out-of-the-box product.

# Features
